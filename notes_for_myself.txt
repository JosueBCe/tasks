============ Content Management System - Final Project ========================
contacts -> Tasks and Subtasks
documents -> Client's projects
messages -> chatting and able to switch in the form for who is submitting


CONTINUE FROM HERE: ADD A METHOD IN CONTACT SERVICE TO GET THE NUMBER
OF COMPLETED TASKS AND WORK syncrounsly WITH ANGULAR TU DISPLAY

idea: CHANGE DELETE FUNCTIONALITY TO COMPLETE
(DELETE BUTTON NOW IS IN THE COMPLETED TASKS LIST AND IT WILL BE TO DELETE PERMANENTLY )
TO PASS FROM ONE LIST TO A HIDDEN LIST OF
- pass from a list to other boolean ngif
- restore and delete permanently button
  - (contact detail with different color )
- drop down functionality


steps:
- create second list ngif completed
- add new caractheristic to the tasks = contacts => boolean => completed true or false
- method to update true or false
- detail component different (color, and button "delete permanently"=> service delete service, with
crossed line in the texts or something like that)
- add total number of completed tasks
- drop down functionality
















tasks:
- ability to add coments to tasks and assigned


- Styling: dark blue classic professional✅

- add video or something cool functionality
- add functionality to which user is posting the message (message page)

ideas to implement:
-> able to add in the tasks what project is working
-> able to add a date in tasks
-> thread in messages to say what they are talking about ( a banner or something similar to show that started a new thread)
